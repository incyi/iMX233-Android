# iMX233-Android
Android build on iMX233 instructions (in Spanish)

These instructions will be to build Android ... with linux kernel version 2.6.28 booting with U-BOOT and running busybox on the iMX233-OLinuXino from Olimex.

The website linuxencaja.net is since 2 years down. And I wanted to build Android for my iMX233 OLinuXino board from Olimex. So I started to search for instructions and found this in Spanish. First I want to try it for myself. Then I will translate it to English.
